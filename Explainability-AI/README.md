Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to analyze and predict electricity consumption in a region (e.g., Nouvelle-Aquitaine) based on temporal data while identifying potential anomalies. Key aspects include:

Visualization of energy consumption and production trends.

Predictive modeling to anticipate hourly consumption.

Anomaly detection using unsupervised algorithms.

Model explainability to understand factors influencing consumption.

üìä Key Results

üîç Exploratory Analysis

Electricity consumption exhibits daily variations (peaks during the day) and seasonal variations (higher in winter).

Renewable energy sources (wind, solar) contribute significantly but vary across periods.

Strong correlations between consumption and thermal/nuclear production.

ü§ñ Predictive Modeling

Model used: Ridge Regression

Explanatory variables: hour, day of the week, thermal production

Model performance in Nouvelle-Aquitaine region:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 655.66 MW

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): 834.77 MW

‚ö†Ô∏è Anomaly Detection

Methods used: Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor

Results: About 1% of the data is marked as anomalies (abnormally high or low consumption).

üìà Interactive Visualizations

Time-series graphs (Plotly) showing the evolution of consumption and anomalies.

Comparison of energy production sources with customized color palettes.
